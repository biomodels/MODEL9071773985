This model relates to figure 5 in <a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entre
z/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12779455">Bhalla
US, Iyengar R. Chaos (2001) 11(1):221-226</a>. It includes the model used for
figures 2-4 and also has MKP-1 induction by MAPK activity in the synapse. PP2A
is set to 0.16 uM and MKP synthesis is varied from 5x to 40 x basal to get a
range of interesting behaviours.
