To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/MODEL9071773985.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import MODEL9071773985 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

# Model Notes
This model relates to figure 5 in <a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entre
z/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12779455">Bhalla
US, Iyengar R. Chaos (2001) 11(1):221-226</a>. It includes the model used for
figures 2-4 and also has MKP-1 induction by MAPK activity in the synapse. PP2A
is set to 0.16 uM and MKP synthesis is varied from 5x to 40 x basal to get a
range of interesting behaviours.
